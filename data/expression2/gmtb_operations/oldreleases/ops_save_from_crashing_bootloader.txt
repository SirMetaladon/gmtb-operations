@name OPS Scratchboard

TODO:
fix car blocking (sort by job, then final destination)
make auto printout for posting in FC&N + automatically save data - automatic awarding
explore crash bug at long running times (???)
make coming and going jobs different colors (and/or figure out multicolor tags)
system that shows how long it took for cars to reach destinations
automatic job guessing (system that determines who the YM is)
scoring takes into account time spent on the server (and displays this) - make sure to make it time interacting with cars w/ leniency instead of just "online" time
compile data from old ops sessions to determine baselines
somehow make downtown a 2-engine job (transfer and local?)
improve routing for blocked empties to prevent constant fishing out of loop cars for outbounds (logs and coal) - solve with "sector" system that can confine coal to a dedicated loop
make jobs version for aoh and commonwealth
job board suggest what needs to be done - needs to not count cars recently interacted with
make job board differentiate between delivered, currently/recently worked cars, and idle cars
make job 804 (laz job) and 501 (north shorts) more fun
spawn specific job via roller - use sector system?
random job spawner via "what is currently lacking"
split out outbound cars to towns via sub-yard (sargeant, yale, south, etc for memphis)?
staging rebuild: generic "inbound transfer" and "inbound block" trains with randomized pre & post destinations picked from list
figure out multijob system to give YM a choice of trains to send cars with (mainline only)
make blocking system at point of origination for trains where the YM is given instructions on the best way to block
randomized trains > ".train 10 southbound" > picks from the "southbound" weighted precompiled roller of southbound yard-bound jobs (transfers, hotshots, etc) (maybe not one that currently exists in the world)
give ym a score based on blocking effectiveness (and maybe switch crews returning to the yard, score consist when any 1 car enters the yard and give all cars the "blocked" marker until they are all reclassed
preblock trains based on job (might involve generating the car route at a different step of the process, as currently it's too late to sort the cars on)
make a record of time per player spent doing individual jobs
for some reason records of spawns and deletions are innacurate - make system wait for confirmation before sending next ping
tropicana clarity + remarking?
make a list of offmap industries and key on-map industries to them with types so coal cars only go to specific power plants and logs only go to specific mills etc
fix tracker bug by making inc feedback that triggers the next send (other system will simply sit on them until proven the transfer is complete)
make system capable of pulling directly from sublet industries
make e2 output an error message when data in the config looks wrong (no box sides, no name, etc)
make temporary system that allows you to force starting train when spawning > picking a type of inbound train (but might not work with routing?)
automatically generated YM outline of what trains come in and out (and maybe what they should prepare for given the state of the railroad)
make "being an interchange" not overwrite "work", but the other way around; define interchange percentage, then you can change or zero out various values within it and it will automatically recalculate
make it like the original where it calculates what you can get to with the current job then spawns cars and types based on that
make e2 command that prints available industry and yard tracks to spawn on
interacts score
mark outbound exits with trains that leave via those locations
bonk doesn't work on cars on the final destination
wolfram local industries & redwall grain mill
figure out how to make staging trains fun
make e2 change physical look of car when loaded or unloaded (holos or bodygroups)
hank bulkhead and tanker incorrect height
stahlburg lake not working
501 reclassifying odd directly to mainline trains
make holo hitboxes togglable while running
make .clarify usable by everyone (in fact it'd be cool to periodically run it on cars recently classified)
remove pseudocode
remove nonfunctional bits
automatically show colors that are too close to each other for jobs and tracks
make "retag" system set route length to a specific point along the route instead of deleting info so you don't get double-retags and you can rewind to see where a car came from
data tracker bugs out when desynced and goes into a mad dash
differentiate kahuna and redwall "dodgers"
board colors still not working
make SCC more substantial and less switching
system that looks at outbound traffic and picks inbounds to satisfy it (block swaps)
move even more traffic to Wolfram (make RWD larger? make RFL or KHD come from Wolfram? More staging trains?)
make it so entering staging trains have traffic not destined to immediately leave the yard and go elsewhere (IE GDT isn't 75% cars for wolfram and vice versa)
only allow very specific staging trains to have cross-map run
make system that detects what cars can be reached from this point and generates inbound trains accordingly
command that
Make interchanges that behave like normal industries with offmap -1 (use overwritten work only)
Make exceptions list for interchange automatic multipliers for cars designed to cycle between special industries and staging; they can use  existing routes and trains, but they stay isolated.
Train presets; track, length, destinations and blocking order, starting train vs cont. run, weight, how many trains between runs, etc
Will need train queuing system
Extended start up sequence for ops that queues a whole bunch of trains that can be scaled by some total target car count that also starts the session timer. 
Figure out how to get trains that terminate in staging to work correctly (IE all pickups go to end of line but trains elsewhere on the railroad don't route to the local just to get to the end)
Make preset spawning allow multiple tracks, with length / special case routing to make length of spawning relative to track length
When staging local goes to staging, use that as the trigger to spawn cars for return trip to reduce people starting at the wrong end
Figure out e2 write to internet function so I can gather data remotely 
Run staging routing deliver to roller in reverse to get car types for outbound trains
Automatic updated checklists for locals so people know what to do
Hold for Reclassification type to prevent oversized locals from going out
Limit how many cars can be going to small industries either present or inbound at any given time.
Use linear interpolation to interpolate between distances of cars on tracks ingame to lines on dispatch board so you can condense trains on to board space and give Dispatch an idea of what's on the railroad and where it is at track scale
Do initial ranging check, then only compare local points to save resources. If farther than the standard distance, check more points. If a point cant be found within standard range, assume the car is derailed.
